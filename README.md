## Telecom Customer Churn Prediction
**Description:** An end-to-end machine learning project that identifies customers at risk of churning for a telecommunications company. The project covers data ingestion, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and training four classifiers — with actionable retention recommendations grounded in the data.
**Key Highlights:**
- Conducted EDA on 7K telecom customers (26% churn); uncovered M2M contracts & early tenure as top drivers, enabling targeted retention spend.
- Engineered 5 domain-driven risk features via chi-squared selection, cutting noise and providing sharper churn signal for business prioritization.
- Built 4 tuned classifiers (SMOTE + 5-fold CV); XGBoost: ROC-AUC 0.843, recall 0.80, operationalizes proactive customer scoring.
- Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize key drivers and prioritize high-risk customers efficiently.
